Questions

1. Why is the fs core module important for Node development?

A: It's a way for a server language to access files on the server.

2. What is the difference between sync and non-sync methods in the fs
module?

Sync methods execute code sequentially, waiting for each line to complete before
moving on to another line.  These methods block all other processes
until the running ones are done.  Asynchronous methods do the opposite.  They are
non-blocking and they execute sequentially but don't need to finish before the
next line of code executes.

3. Why are modules used?

You use a module to access libraries.

4. Why are libraries such as fs used in Node programming?

You need these to access the file system of the server.


Code Practice

Create a Github repo called simple-http-node-server. Create an HTTP server
on port 3000 with a request handler that creates a file named
hello-world.txt. You will be using the fs module to do this. Write the
content: "Hello to this great world" to the hello-world.txt file. Please
submit your finished code in your submission.

See create_hello_world.js
